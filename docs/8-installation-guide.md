   - Check for correct formatting
   - Ensure no trailing spaces
   - Verify GROQ_LLM_KEY is properly set

3. **Database Connection**

   - Verify MongoDB is running
   - Check connection strings
   - Confirm network access

4. **Docker Issues**
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running
   - Check Docker logs for errors
